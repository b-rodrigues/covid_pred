# Introduction

The Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg is a country that is unique in many ways. As its official name quite
clearly indicates, it is a grand duchy, the last of its kind on earth. It is a relatively young
country, as it became a grand duchy once it gained independence from Napoleonic France in 1815 (but
was pretty much still a puppet state of the Kingdom of the Netherlands until the end of the
19th century), is one of the founding members of the European Coal and Steel Community, which
evolved to become the European Union and has three official languages: French, German, and Luxembourguish.
Luxembourg is also a landlocked country, sandwiched between France, Germany and Belgium. This 
geographic position has given Luxembourg many advantages. One such advantage is that its labour
force, which amounts to 400000 workers and is composed of 50\% of French, German and Belgian commuters.
This is also the reason why Luxembourg has one of the highest GDPs per capita in the world: half
of its riches are produced by foreigners which are not taken into account in the computation of 
GDP per capita.

Half of Luxembourg's population is also composed of foreigners, the largest community being the 
Portuguese, followed by the French.

In this article, I posit the following hypothesis: due to its quite unique characteristics, 
the spread of COVID-19 in a landlocked country like Luxembourg is the exact opposite of the 
spread of COVID-19 that can be observed on an island country such as New Zealand, or Madagascar.
A landlocked country like Luxembourg, which is furthermore highly dependent on foreign workers, 
has many more difficulties to control the spread of COVID-19 within its borders. Unlike an island
country, a landlocked country that is highly tied to its neighbours cannot simply close its borders
and put a very hard lockdown in place to control the pandemic. Or if the landlocked country
does that, as soon as it opens its borders, the disease will start spreading again.
To illustrate this idea, I will discuss how COVID-19 starting spreading, but not only within the 
borders of Luxembourg, but rather within the so-called Greater Region. 
The Greater Region *a space for cross-border cooperation in the heart of Europe* and 
is composed of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, two Belgian Provinces, two French Départements and 
two German Bundesländer.

  \label{commuters}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{commuters} show a map of the Greater Region with the flows of daily commuters between
its constituent regions. Every day, according to this map from 2018, more than 150000 commuters
go to Luxembourg to work. In 2019, it was reported that this number reached 200000.\footnote{\url{https://paperjam.lu/article/plus-200-000-frontaliers-sur-m}}

The goal of this work is thus as follows: I will train machine learning models to predict the 
spread of COVID-19 in Luxembourg using openly available data on the weekly positive cases of 
COVID-19. However, because of the very tight economic and social integration of Luxembourg to its 
neighbours I will use as features weekly positive cases in the border regions as well as 
Google Mobility data\footnote{\url{https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/}} for Luxembourg
to proxy for hard, and soft, lockdowns. I will show that weekly, and most importantly lags of 
weekly cases in the neighbouring regions predict cases for Luxembourg.

# The data used

Data on positive cases from the regions of the Greater Region was collected through each of the 
countries' open data portal. The levels of detail were heterogeneous, with Belgium and Germany
providing a high level of detail (daily cases by sex, age group, Province in the case of Belgium, and
Land- and Stadtkreise in the case of Germany), followed by France (daily cases by department and
age group), with Luxembourg providing the least amount of details; only daily cases at the national
level. 
In order to simplify the process of getting the data from all these sources, we wrote an R package
called `{covidGrandeRegion}` which can be found on the following [github repository](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/covidGrandeRegion).
This R package provides several functions to download daily or weekly data, either for one single country or for 
the whole of the Greater Region as well as a function to call an interactive map of the region
with a timeline, making it easy to visualise the spread of the disease through the region. It is also
possible to normalize the data by dividing the daily or weekly cases by the size of the population
in each sub-region.
Another variable that was included comes from the [Google Mobility website](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/).
This data shows on a daily basis how communities move since the start of the pandemic. This data
is used here as proxy for lockdowns. The plot below shows the daily percentage change in time 
spent at home in Luxembourg:

The hard lockdown from March and April can be clearly seen in the data.
